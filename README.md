# General Info

Welcome to my Jotter github!
### Status: Complete

### What is Jotter?
Jotter is an app where users can securely store, create, and manage any notes they may have or need from anywhere they want. Jotter also implements user authentication so your notes can only be seen by your eyes. 

My goal in creating this app was a way to hone my skills. Through the app I was able to practice building an api, designing and creating datasbase architecture, authentication practices, and working with React/Redux.
